Author(s):  üöÄ Me & ChatGPT3

A group of python scripts that allow you to perform specific tasks that would otherwise take you a looong time when handling multiple files.

Backstory: üìñ I wrote these to handle *.json* files in particular when I had to migrate data from a company's database to Google Sheets for analysis.
